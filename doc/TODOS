| CCOAP - CoAP implementation in C |
+----------------------------------+

A wishlist of improvements for CCOAP:

* Application types must be registered statically in the 
  lib/ccoapapps/server_handlers/handlers.h and 
  lib/ccoapapps/client_tasks/tasks.h file. It should be 
  done differently. For example, on the server side, 
  application type should be registered according to the
  URI that is being accessed.

* API should be extended with more functions, e.g. to get 
  the message header code (instead of accessing msg->hdr.code),
  or create message options easily.
